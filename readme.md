This project is for the exam for the course Statistical Machine Learning at [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk)

##Course description
The overall task for the course was to use statistical machine learning to perform digit recognizion. 
Each participating student in the course filled out 200 of each number from 0 to 9 in order to figure out who has the worst hand writing.

##Project description
- Problem 1 (easier problem): The digit recognition problem for simnple 90/10 split of complete data
- Problem 2 (hard problem): The digit recognition problem for one person (test set) versus all other persons (training set)
- Explain how you have derived your input vector. Argue for what would be an optimal preprocessing. Visual preprocessing flow and inbetween steps.
- Choose two methods to solve the two problem. Argue which quality of performance you expect and why
- Describe the methods briefly and discuss the relevant parameters
- Analyze the performance of the algorithm depending on the critical parameters on test and training set on both problems
  * Accuracy
  * If possible show effect of overfitting
  * Measure timing 
- Discuss what further could be done to improve performance and if possible do it
- Once you have designed the best possible version of the algorithms, perform a proper cross validation
- Determine who has the worst writing according to your method
