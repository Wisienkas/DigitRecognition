During the course SML, the introduced techniques for preprocessing and classification of the given digit recognition was a success.\\
Both k-means, PCA and Gaussian Smoothing proved to be worth using in most cases, with the effect that the success rate would increase and the classification or test time would decrease.\\ 
KNN and Random Forests are two algorithms which both yielded a good results with Random Forest just a bit higher than KNN.\\
It was easily noticeable the impact different settings had on the algorithms and preprocessing where some setting would give a low result, changing that same setting to a different value would increase the result by a large margin.\\It was also decided that it was not fair to say one single person has the worst hand writing, instead 'member 1 from group 2' and 'member 3 from group 4' was chosen as the worst writers in the course.
