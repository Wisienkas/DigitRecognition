The possibility to recognize text and digits in computer science has been available for a long time. The correctness of this has however increased within the last decade, with the rapid development of computers and their processing power. A normal computer is therefore able to process a relative large dataset and then use statistical machine learning to recognize a test set.\\
The course SML\footnote{Statistical Machine Learning} has introduced several different algorithms to recognize digits (and text), some with more success than others. It has also introduced different preprocessing techniques which can be applied to the dataset before running the algorithm, which also increase the success.\\\\
The goal of this report is to dig deeper into two chosen algorithms and analyze them in order to get as good performance and accuracy as possible. Moreover it will be decided, based on these two algorithms, who has the worst hand writing in the class.\\
The chosen algorithms are KNN\footnote{K-Nearest Neighbor} and Random Forest. Different preprocessing techniques will be used in order to achieve the best results.
