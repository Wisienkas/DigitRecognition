Below are a short description of each of the different algorithms and techniques which has been used, with focus on the different parameters which can be changed.

\subsection{Gaussian Smoothing}
When working on recognizing text in an image, it is desired to get as sharp an image as possible, where all edges of each letter is easily distinctable from the white space around it. This can be achieved by applying a blur to the image, also known as Gaussian Smoothing.\\ 
The kernel will be in the form of a grid, where the height and width will determine how many pixels the smoothing will be applied to, alternatively it can be specified as a radius, depending on what implementation of the algorithm is used.\\
It is therefore desirable to look at both the size of the kernel and the amount of smoothing when trying to get the best setting. In the project, a package called 'EBImage'\footnote{http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html} does this for us, the amount of smoothing is called sigma, and the kernel has this default formula 
\begin{lstlisting}
	2*ceiling(3*sigma)+1)
\end{lstlisting}
An example of this effect can be seen at figure~\ref{fig:imgExplainBlur} where an image with and without the blur is illustrated.
