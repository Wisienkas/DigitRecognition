The following section contains the results of the implementation section.

\subsection{KNN}
\label{sec:resultKNN}
The result of the easy problem with KNN can be seen at figure~\ref{fig:knnEasyProblem}. The setting with 'sigma = 1' in smoothing and 0.99 principle components gives a success of approx 86\% with k as 1. The algorithm was also tested with K-Means, but initial testing shown that the time to compute the k-means was too significant and the end result was a lot lower than with PCA, also if done in combination with PCA.\\
One thing to note is that there are not a big difference with the k-values, they are however slowly dropping in success the higher a k-value.

The best settings from the easy problem was then used with the hard problem, and the results can be seen at figure~\ref{fig:knnHardProblem}, where the best hand writing is at approx 84\% success and the worst is at approx 42\%. Running with different k-values and PCA percentages did not change much, it was still the same two people low in the success and the same two to three with the highest success.
